# Super glasses

## Abstract

The view through glasses can easily get blocked due to rain drops or fogging and 
cleaning it means taking it off. Since this action can be a hassle, 
Super glasses can clean themselves by clicking on a button. 
Additionally, they can display emotions, as glasses tend to cover the eyebrows.
