# Super glasses

## Abstract

The view through glasses can easily get blocked due to rain drops or fogging and 
cleaning it means taking it off. Since this action can be a hassle, 
Super glasses can clean themselves by clicking on a button. 
Additionally, they can display emotions, as glasses tend to cover the eyebrows.

## Introduction

The idea is to have wippers be attached to the glasses 
so that the glasses will clean themselves.
A button click starts the servo motors 
which perform the cleaning motion with the wippers on it.
